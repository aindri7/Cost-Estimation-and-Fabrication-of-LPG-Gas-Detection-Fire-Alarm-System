# Cost Estimation and Fabrication of LPG gas detection and fire alarm system
This system deals with the detection of LPG gas leakage and fire. Then protect the place with the help of water sprinkler and sending the location via sms to the multiple devices and giving emergency calls.
## Introduction
Fire hazard is the most common hazard, which is present in all areas of life. Fire hazard can be occurs from Lpg gas, Unattended cooking, Electrical systems that are overloaded, Poorly maintained or defective, Flammable liquids or vapour, Dust, Objects that generate heat and from many more sources. Kitchen fires and fires from Lpg gas are most common fire hazard for residence home nowadays. Fire accidents caused an average of 62 deaths per day in the last 5 years. The National Crime Records Bureau data indicates that a total of 113961 people lost their lives due to fire accidents from 2010 to 2014. This is an average of 62 deaths a day. Maharashtra alone accounted for 24293 deaths or 21.3% of all the deaths due to fire accidents. Thatâ€™s why learning about fire safety and applying proper equipments for own safety is important. Our project will help us to minimise fire hazards. This project is a complete protection system. If any gas leakage occurs then it will detect the gas with the help of MQ2 sensor. And alert anyone near to the incident by using of buzzer. Even if fire hazard occurs it will detect it quickly and the alarming system will work again. We can quickly get the information of the hazard by sms or emergency call and also come to know about the exact location of the incident. This automatic protection system will automatically spread water after occurring any kind of fire hazard.
